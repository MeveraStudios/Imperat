 * The {@code ThrowableHandler} interface defines a mechanism for managing and resolving

 * information.

    /**
     * Registers a {@link ThrowableResolver} for a specific exception type and returns
     * the registered resolver instance. This method allows for fluent configuration
     * of exception handling strategies while providing access to the registered resolver.
     *
     * <p>The registered resolver will be invoked when exceptions of a specified type
     * (or its subtypes, depending on implementation) occur during command execution.
     * This method enables type-safe registration where the exception class and resolver
     * generic types must match.
     *
     * <p><strong>Example usage:</strong>
     * <pre>{@code
     * ThrowableResolver<CommandPermissionException, CommandSource> permissionResolver =
     *     setThrowableResolver(CommandPermissionException.class, (exception, context) -> {
     *         context.source().sendMessage("Â§cYou don't have permission: " + exception.getPermission());
     *         // Additional logging or cleanup
     *     });
     *
     * // Can be used for method chaining or further configuration
     * permissionResolver.andThen(someOtherAction);
     * }</pre>
     *
     * <p><strong>Type Safety:</strong> The generic constraint ensures that only resolvers
     * capable of handling the specified exception type can be registered, preventing
     * runtime {@link ClassCastException}s during exception resolution.
     *
     * <p><strong>Resolver Precedence:</strong> If a resolver already exists for the given
     * exception type, this method will typically replace it. Refer to the implementation
     * documentation for specific behavior regarding resolver conflicts.
     *
     * <p><strong>Inheritance Behavior:</strong> Depending on the implementation, the
     * resolver may handle subclasses of the specified exception type. Check the
     * concrete implementation's documentation for exact inheritance semantics.
     *
     * @param <T> the specific exception type that the resolver will handle,
     *           must extend {@link Throwable}
     * @param exception the {@link Class} object representing the exception type
     *                 to register a resolver for, must not be {@code null}
     * @param resolver the {@link ThrowableResolver} implementation that will handle
     *                exceptions to the specified type, must not be {@code null}
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if either {@code exception} or {@code resolver} is {@code null}
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if resolver registration is not supported
     *                                      for the given exception type
