/**
 * Represents the result of a command execution operation in the Imperat framework.
 *
 * <p>This class follows a Result/Either pattern, encapsulating either a successful
 * command execution with its associated context and search results, or a failure
 * state with error information. This design allows for safe error handling without
 * throwing exceptions during command processing.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage Examples:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Creating a successful result
 * ExecutionResult<MySource> success = ExecutionResult.of(context, search);
 *
 * // Creating a failure result with specific error
 * ExecutionResult<MySource> failure = ExecutionResult.failure(new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid command"));
 *
 * // Creating a generic failure result
 * ExecutionResult<MySource> genericFailure = ExecutionResult.failure();
 *
 * // Checking and handling results
 * if (result.hasFailed()) {
 *     Throwable error = result.getError(); // May be null for generic failures
 *     // Handle error case
 * } else {
 *     ExecutionContext<MySource> context = result.getContext();
 *     CommandPathSearch<MySource> search = result.getSearch();
 *     // Process successful execution
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> This class is immutable and thread-safe once constructed.</p>
